# 24 Pull Requests Dashboard

> **Giving back little gifts of code**

24 Pull Requests is a yearly initiative to encourage developers around the world to send a pull request every day in December up to Christmas.

This is the dashboard that helps us keep track of what's happening! You can help us build it too.

The dashboard is built on [Dashing](http://shopify.github.com/dashing)

# Development

Source hosted here at [GitHub](http://github.com/24pullrequests/dashboard).
Report issues/feature requests on [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/24pullrequests/dashboard/issues). Follow us on Twitter [@24pullrequests](https://twitter.com/24pullrequests). We also hangout on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/24pullrequests/24pullrequests).

## Installation

Fork the repository and then clone it locally.

`bundle install` from within the dashing folder.

You should also install the `dashing` gem:

`gem install dashing`

To start the server, run `dashing start` and then view the awesome at `localhost:3030`

## Contributing

 * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
 * Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

## Gotchas

If you receive the error `Unable to activate pry-byebug-1.3.2` whilst `bundle install`ing then try running `gem update pry` and then `bundle install` again.
